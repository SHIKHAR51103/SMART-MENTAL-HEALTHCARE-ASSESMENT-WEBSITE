The present study is an attempt to introduce a new
paradigm in the assessment of psychological well-being through
a set of established tests like Emotional Quotient Inventory, Beck
Depression Inventory, Perceived Stress Scale, Wechsler Adult
Intelligence Scale, and Color Name Guessing Test. These questionnaires
were kept on a newly developed website, ’Sanjeevani,’
having an easy-to-use interface developed with HTML, CSS, JS,
and PHP. The test scores were further analyzed with machine
learning algorithms: Random Forest Classifier and K-Nearest
Neighbors implemented in Python. This study will look into
the efficiency and accuracy of the algorithms in predicting the
psychological states. Results are presented in different graphical
forms.
